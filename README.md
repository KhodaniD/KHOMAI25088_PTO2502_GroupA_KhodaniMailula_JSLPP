## Key Features

### Core Functionality
* **Fully Responsive Design:** Adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes, from desktop to mobile, ensuring a great user experience on any device.
* **Persistent Data:** All tasks are saved to and loaded from the browser's **Local Storage**, ensuring your progress is always saved, even if you close the application.
* **Dynamic Task Rendering:** Tasks are generated and managed dynamically using JavaScript, not hard-coded HTML. This ensures a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase.
* **Task Priority:** A key feature for visual organization. Each task card includes a priority dot, making it easy to quickly identify the importance of a task at a glance.


### User Interface & Navigation
* **Themed Styling:** The application features a professional light and **dark mode theme**, which can be easily toggled by the user. This functionality is powered by **CSS Variables**, which allows for robust and maintainable styling and makes it simple to customize the color palette.
* **Desktop Sidebar:** On larger screens, a dedicated sidebar provides clear navigation and theme-toggling options.
* **Mobile Menu Modal:** For smaller screens, a compact, header-based menu provides a clean navigation experience, overlaying the main content to avoid clutter.
* **Custom Form Validation:** Provides immediate, user-friendly feedback for required fields, guiding users to complete forms correctly.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Provides the semantic and structural foundation of the application.
* **CSS3:** Manages all styling, including a comprehensive responsive design. It utilizes **CSS Variables** for streamlined theme management and **Flexbox** for flexible, dynamic layouts.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Powers all dynamic behavior and logic. The codebase follows a **modular architecture**, with files separated by responsibility (`main.js`, `tasks.js`, `modal.js`, `storage.js`) for better organization and maintainability. It also features advanced **DOM manipulation**, comprehensive **event handling**, and the use of the **Web Storage API** for data persistence.
* **Google Fonts:** Uses 'Plus Jakarta Sans' for a consistent, modern, and readable typography.

## Interaction Instructions

This project provides interactive task management directly via the user interface:

### Adding a New Task
1.  Click the **"+ Add New Task"** button located in the top right of the header.
2.  A modal will appear. Enter the task's title (required) and description in the provided input fields.
3.  Select the desired status ("todo", "doing", or "done") from the dropdown.
4.  Click the **"Create Task"** button. If the title is empty, a validation message will appear. Otherwise, the new task will instantly appear on the Kanban board in the chosen column.

### Editing an Existing Task
1.  Click on any task card displayed on the Kanban board.
2.  An "Edit Task" modal will open, pre-filled with the task's current title, description, and status.
3.  Modify any of the details as needed.
4.  Change the task's status using the dropdown if you wish to move it to another column.
5.  Click the **"Save Changes"** button. If the title is empty, a validation message will appear. Otherwise, the task will update on the board, moving to a new column if its status was changed.

### Deleting a Task
1.  Click on the task card you wish to delete to open the "Edit Task" modal.
2.  Inside the modal, click the **"Delete Task"** button.
3.  The task will be immediately removed from the Kanban board after a confirmation prompt.

### Closing the Modal
* To close any open modal without saving changes, click the **'X' icon** in the top right corner of the modal.

This Kanban board now serves as a robust example of dynamic UI rendering, interactive task management (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and responsive design, providing a complete and intuitive user experience.
